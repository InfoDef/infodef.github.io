In practice, company executives prefer a simple definition of 
intellectual capital: aggregate of intangible, or
intangible assets, which are not specified in financial documents
of the company, but can be codified, evaluated and managed by the company.
Some large corporations(ВР, British American Tobacco, Novo
Nordisk) in 2004 provided besides financial statements so
called non-financial reports. They are directly related to
intellectual capital, because they reveal to the public those assets,
which is difficult to evaluate in financial terms. Company Skandia, Dow
Chemical Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce attached to annual reports
with traditional financial indicators, as well as reports for
domestic use, valuation of intellectual capital.
Such world famous consulting companies, us Booz - Allen &
Hamilton, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, also use the concept
intellectual capital in explaining to clients the structure of their
intangible assets, especially those, which become key
success factors. knowledge management give lead in
direction of strategic development, pays attention to resources,
which have become main today and at the same time not always efficiently

							<h2>Using of gamification</h2>
							<p class="text" align="justify">
							
The educational process at the departments of a specific profile requires
also the exercise of individual control over the work
each student, for his personal learning activities, does not allow
substitution of individual student learning outcomes for work
groups and vice versa. Modern technologies allow significantly
optimize this process. The student gets the opportunity to perform
tasks at an individual pace, which is especially important when
using the controlling tasks of the second and third
level. Computer processing of the results allows
get a picture of the performance of each student in the dynamics, 
also statistics of group performance, course. A joint
use of the rating system provides additional features
to analyze the effectiveness of the pedagogical process.

							</p>						
							<p class="text" align="justify">

Objectivity control using information
technology eliminates the teacher’s subjective opinions, based
on the insufficient study of the individual properties of students or
prejudice to them. In this case, to all students
common requirements, and work is evaluated in accordance
with uniform regulations and standards. One of the most 
important factors use of information technology in monitoring success
student learning activities is its independence. 
Lack of contact with the examiner, examination board
associated with significantly less stress for the student,
raises his hopes for objectivity of evaluation and confidence in
the results. The pedagogical aspects of widespread adoption are ambiguous
self-study students. One side, goals self
work is the activation of mental activity, development
the ability to independently solve cognitive tasks,
practical application of acquired knowledge, skills. 
With another, the organization of the process of self-training involves
development of a mechanism for managing the process of learning software
educational material, requiring important tasks: definition
volume and nature of self-study, selection of sources
scientific information, learning how to work with benefits.

							<p class="text" align="justify">


So, gamification in training solves several problems at once:<br />
     • attracting students to the educational process;<br />
     • increase motivation and interest in success;<br />
     • increase learning comprehensibility;<br />
     • stimulation of interest in further development
      and education.<br />
Modern gaming systems can be used
for individual or group training. Also created
teacher relationship improvement programs
a student, contributing to increased confidence and achievement.
