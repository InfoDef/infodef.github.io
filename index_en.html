	Gamification is the application of game-design elements and game
principles in non-game contexts. Gamification commonly employs
game design elements to improve user engagement, organizational
productivity, flow, learning, crowdsourcing, employee recruitment
and evaluation, ease of use, usefulness of systems, physical
exercise, traffic violations, voter apathy, and more. A collection
of research on gamification shows that a majority of studies on
gamification find it has positive effects on individuals. However,
individual and contextual differences exist.

Education and training are areas where there has been interest in
gamification. Microsoft released the game Ribbon Hero 2 as an add-on
to their Office productivity suite to help train people to use it
effectively, this project was described by Microsoft as one of the
most popular projects its Office Labs division ever released. The
New York City Department of Education with funding from the MacArthur
Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has set up a
school called Quest to Learn centred around game-based learning, with
the intent to make education more engaging and relevant to modern
kids. SAP has used games to educate their employees on sustainability.
The US military and Unilever have also used gamification in their
training.</p><br />

The Khan Academy is an example of the use of gamification
techniques in online education. In August 2009, Gbanga launched the
educational location-based game Gbanga Zooh for Zurich Zoo that asked
participants to actively save endangered animals and physically bring
them back to a zoo. Players maintained virtual habitats across the
Canton of Zurich to attract and collect endangered species of animals.
There is some indication that gamification can be particularly
motivational for students with dyslexia in educational situations.

Gamification is used in corporate training to motivate employees to
apply what they learned in the training to their job, theoretically
this should improve performance. According to a study conducted by
Badgeville, 78% of workers are utilizing games-based motivation at work
and nearly 91% say these systems improve their work experience by
increasing engagement, awareness and productivity.
