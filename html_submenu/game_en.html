					<h2>Game classification:</h2>
					<p class="text" align="justify">
						
In order to somehow streamline the diversity of games, it 
was proposed to separate them by two parameters:<br />

						
     1. Use of game elements. On this axis, on one side will be
      to play a full game (whole game), in which are used
      all the game elements she needs. Нand the other is use
      individual game elements (Parts)
     <br />
						
     2.Game \ Entertainment (Gaming \ Playing). Need to stay here
      and figure it out, how is the game different from entertainment. 
      By entertainment (playing) is meant aimless waste of energy. 
      She is spontaneous and has no goals, Besides
      enjoyment. Entertainment is freedom of action, 
     inside a certain rigid framework.boundaries exist, 
     can not go beyond them, but inside these boundaries is complete, 
     unrestricted freedom.
     <br />

						
The game is a cruel and orderly structure, with certain rules. 
It draws participants to some conflict. Move
development of the conflict and its outcome depends on 
the actions of participants, from their conscious choice.<br />
There are 3 basic game requirements:<br />
						
    1. Each game must pursue game goals.<br />
									
    2. The game goes according to established and unchanged rules.
    Rules govern actions of players;<br />
						   
    3. Game form. Players know the rules and voluntarily abide by them.<br />
						    
The game is a voluntary overcoming of artificial obstacles.
Every game has borders, which may be real
(football field limits) or virtual (existing in
players mind). Within these boundaries, the game is real for everyone
of the participants, it attracts them to the process and motivates to
continue the game. That is why the problem of gamification - how can
tighten the user to the created virtual world of the game.<br />

In gamification need use next tasks:<br />
    • the player’s decision must be voluntary;<br />
    • the player must either learn something new, or
     solve some problem;<br />
    • there must be a balance between the structure of the game and
     free trial.<br />
Virtual and real worlds constantly interact. In the virtual 
world is simulated real. Real world borrows some technology from virtual.
